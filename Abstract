An audio amplifier is an Electronic circuit that amplifies low-power audio signals to a level suitable for driving Loudspeaker. 
These Amplifiers are used in wireless communications and broadcasting, and in audio equipment of all kinds. 
There are many classes of Amplifiers and we have previously built a lot of Audio Amplifier circuits ranging from small 10W amplifiers to heavy 100W Power amplifiers. 
In this project, we are going to build an Audio Amplifier using TDA2822 IC which is a very popular dual-channel audio amplifier commonly used to build high power audio amplifiers. 
The TDA2822 amplifier circuit will have one TDA2822 amplifier IC and will be able to drive two Speakers with volume control. 
Also, the audio input for our amplifier board can be provided directly from an audio jack. 
To build this TDA2822 Stereo Amplifier on a PCB, we have fabricated our PCB boards from PCB Way and we will assemble and test the same in this project.
